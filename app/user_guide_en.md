## What is LHP?

Lung Health Premonitions (LHP) is a tool intended to support medical personnel in the diagnosis of lung cancer via a simple questionnaire. Thanks to about fifteen questions about the patient's lifestyle and mild health problems, LHP is able to provide a prediction that gives a first idea of the patient's condition.

## Disclaimer

It is clear that LHP does not replace a medical consultation with a health professional, it only facilitates the care of the patient and to quickly make the right decision for the treatment of his condition.
